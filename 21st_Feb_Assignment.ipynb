    "###### Manual scraping: This involves copying and pasting data from web pages into a structured format manually. This method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it is useful for small-scale scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Automated scraping: This involves using software tools to extract data from websites automatically. The following are some common methods used for automated web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### HTML parsing: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a web page to extract data. It involves using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, lxml, or jsoup to parse HTML and extract the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### XPath: This method involves using XPath expressions to extract data from web pages. XPath is a query language used to navigate XML documents and can be used to extract data from HTML pages as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Regular expressions: This method involves using regular expressions to extract data from web pages. Regular expressions are patterns that can be used to match and extract specific data from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### API scraping: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. API scraping involves using these APIs to extract data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Headless browsing: This method involves using a headless browser such as Puppeteer or Selenium to automate web scraping. The headless browser simulates a real user's interaction with the website, allowing the scraper to extract data from dynamic websites."
